This repository demonstrates a comprehensive gRPC implementation, covering:

->Unary RPC
->Client Streaming RPC
->Server Streaming RPC
->Bidirectional Streaming RPC

At the end of the project, a complete CRUD application is built using gRPC for communication and MongoDB for data storage. 
Additionally, Mongo Express is integrated to visualize and manage the database content through a web interface.
